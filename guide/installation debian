Creating a Virtual Machine in Virtualbox

    Launch VirtualBox & click New.
    Name Born2beroot, sotre it in /sgoinfre/goinfre/Perso/your_login if at 42, or else on a large USB stick. Choose Linux & Debian.
    1024MB memory is good.
    Create a virtual hard disk now.
    VDI.
    Dynamically allocated.
    10 to 13 GB is enough for both mandatory and bonus parts.
    Start Born2beroot virtual machine.

Installing Debian

    Select Debian ISO image as startup disk.
    When Debian starts, choose Install, not graphcal install.
    Choose language, geographical & keyboard layout settings.
    Hostname must be your_login42 (ex. mcombeau42).
    Domain name leave empty.
    Choose strong root password & confirm.
    Create user. your_login works for username & name.
    Choose password for new user.

Partitioning disks

    Choose Manual partitionning.
    Choose sda Harddisk - SCSI (0,0,0) (sda) ...
    Yes create partition table.

We will crete 2 partitions, the first will be for an unencrypted /boot partition, the other for the encrypted logical volumes :

    pri/log xxGB FREE SPACE >> Create a new partition >> 500 MB >> Primary >> Beginning >> Mount point >> /boot >> Done.
    pri/log xxGB FREE SPACE >> Create a new partition >> max >> Logical >> Mount point >> Do not mount it >> Done.

Encrypting disks

    Configure encrypted volumes >> Yes.
    Create encrypted volumes
    Choose sda5 ONLY to encrypt. We DO NOT want to encrypt the sda /boot partition.
    Done >> Finish >> Yes.
    ... wait for formatting to finish...
    Choose a strong password for disk encryption. DO NOT forget it!

Logical Volume Manager (LVM)

Create a volume group:

    Configure the Logical Volume Manager >> Yes.
    Create Volume Group >> LVMGroup >> /dev/mapper/sda5_crypt.

Create Logical Volumes:

    Create Logical Volume >> LVMGroup >> root >> 2.8G
    Create Logical Volume >> LVMGroup >> home >> 2G
    Create Logical Volume >> LVMGroup >> swap >> 1G
    Create Logical Volume >> LVMGroup >> tmp >> 2G
    Create Logical Volume >> LVMGroup >> srv >> 1.5G
    Create Logical Volume >> LVMGroup >> var >> 2G
    Create Logical Volume >> LVMGroup >> var-log >> 2G

When done, Display configuration details to double check & Finish.

Set filesystems and mount points for each logical volume:

    Under "LV home", #1 xxGB >> Use as >> Ext4 >> Mount point >> /home >> Done
    Under "LV root", #1 xxGB >> Use as >> Ext4 >> Mount point >> / >> Done
    Under "LV swap", #1 xxGB >> Use as >> swap area >> Done
    Under "LV srv", #1 3GB >> Use as >> Ext4 >> Mount point >> /srv >> Done
    Under "LV tmp", #1 3GB >> Use as >> Ext4 >> Mount point >> /tmp >> Done
    Under "LV var", #1 3GB >> Use as >> Ext4 >> Mount point >> /var >> Done
    Under "LV var-log", #1 4GB >> Use as >> Ext4 >> Mount point >> Enter manually >> /var/log >> Done

Scroll down & Finish partitioning and write changes to disk. Yes.
Finish Installation

    No, no need to scan.
    Choose country & mirror.
    Leave proxy field blank.
    No, no need to participate in study.
    Uncheck all software.
    Yes, install GRUB >> /dev/sda
    Continue. Installation complete! The virtual machine will now reboot. Enter encryption password and log into created user.

We can verify that the install went correctly by running the following commands:

$ lsblk
$ cat /etc/os-release
